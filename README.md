# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Diwali Sales Analysis Using Python

DESCRIPTION:
Performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, with a primary focus on data refinement and manipulation. This analysis not only enhanced data quality but also provided valuable insights into customer behavior and sales trends. By scrutinizing the data, we were able to optimize our sales strategies, identify top-performing product categories, and streamline inventory planning. Moreover, our EDA enabled us to refine customer targeting efforts, pinpointing potential buyers across various demographics. This valuable information will be instrumental in crafting more effective marketing and sales campaigns for future Diwali sales events.
